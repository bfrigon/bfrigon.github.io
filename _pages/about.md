# About this blog

This is a blog about my electronic projects, VOIP telephony (Asterisk) and programming. The sole purpose of this blog is to share my experience. I provide all schematics, drawings and source code freely. The articles posted here are not meant to be step-by-step tutorials. 

If you have questions, feel free to ask me but keep in mind that I have limited free time to answer.

If you build something you see on this site, please don't hesitate to email me pictures of it. It's always gratifying to see other people build something i designed.

I do not have any academic training in the electronic engineering field. Everything that i have learned over the years, i did so by experimenting and making mistakes, some costly. If you are an EE expert and see something on this website that makes no sense, please be kind and let me know. Constructive comments are always welcome.
